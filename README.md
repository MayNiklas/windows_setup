# Windows 11 setup

## What I want to achieve

Seriously, I'm not much of a Windows user outside of gaming.
My non existent PowerShell skills are a testament to that.

I hope, that I'm able to write a somewhat helful script,
that will help me to setup a new Windows 11 installation into a gaming ready state.

## What I need to do

- [ ] install needed Powershell modules
- [x] install Windows Updates
- [ ] install drivers
- [ ] make sure winget is installed
- [x] install packages via winget

## Contributing

I'm trying to keep this as simple and generic as possible.
It should be easy to be reused by others, without trusting unknown code.
In case you have the knowledge to help me with one of the tasks above,
please feel free to open a pull request. Help is very wanted and appreciated!
